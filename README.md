# Database-Hotel
In my Database Systems course project, I designed a hotel database, covering ERD creation, normalization (1NF to 3NF), business processes, and transaction management. I implemented and managed the database using SQL, applying DDL and DML to input and manipulate data, demonstrating my skills in database design and management.
